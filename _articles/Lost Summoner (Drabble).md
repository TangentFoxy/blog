Decorations rattled from the boom of suddenly displaced air. A figure appeared in the hallway across from the study. Her eyes met a dragoness on a couch, looking back with a neutral expression. "Where am I? Are you a demon?"

"My home. And it depends on where you are from, summoner.. However, I do enjoy collecting lost souls." She smirked, "You seem a little lost." The dragon stood slowly, tasting the fear radiating from her visitor.

The figure held her ground as the dragoness approached, smile growing wider, "Want to make a deal, my dear?"

â€œWhat kind of a deal?"
