Within a few weeks, Life Field Relay Inc. found itself with the fortunes of several of the wealthiest people and in the pockets of several governments. Backdoor deals were forged, illegal agreements became completely legal, those in office came to stay in office, probably forever.

Slowly, all the power in the world drained into them, and people either worked for them or didn't work. It took about a year for global domination, but it was a sure and steady thing, despite the constant attacks trying to learn the secrets that made their systems work.

It was now just "The Corporation"

_Drabble is a form of extremely short storytelling, where you are limited to exactly 100 words. This one was written [for a challenge](https://oneadayuntilthedayidie.com/?p=14953)._
