Sasha was fixing dinner for Justin and herself, and Justin was laying down outside, resting after a hard day's work. She called out, "Dinner!" when finished, and Justin padded in, happily wagging his tail.

She set his bowl down and her own at the table. Justin was half done by the time Sasha sat down to start eating, and she laughed at his eagerness, "If you want more, go get it yourself."

As Sasha took her first bite, she noticed an odd smell, one she recognized from her teenage years. Her eyes widened with alarm as a gun leveled at her chest, and then fired.

Justin looked over, and was shot too. The assassin put another two rounds in each of them to be sure, and then pulled out a cell phone, "Got them."

*"Both?"*

"Of course."

*"You sure?"*

"Certainly." The phone clicked off, and the assassin turned back to his targets. One of the werewolves bit his throat out, the other muttered, "Got them, my ass."

_Another nearly decade old story, [originally published on Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/7070285), but I don't have the exact date of publication. Oh well. This one involves characters I had written much of a story surrounding their teenage years, but I have since lost._
