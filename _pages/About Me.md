Tangent describes herself as an indie [game developer](https://tangentfox.itch.io/), [programmer](https://github.com/TangentFoxy), [writer](https://blog.tangentfox.com/category/fiction/), and fledgling YouTuber of [video games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZ-RBp_D-a-JIuKDykhegA) and [motorcycles](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_4PhXYRFKik83krty3CHfA). She is interested in making the world a place _for people_, rather than for profit.

She is also occasionally an [artist](https://blog.tangentfox.com/category/art/) of sounds, and visuals – although most evidence of this has been lost to time due to severe depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Previously she has written fan-fiction on an extinct forum, wanted to become an EMT or mechanic, and studied physics.

Her aspirations include developing APIs and web services to help people better understand their own minds and function more how they want to, teaching and sharing information in any form (that’s part of why this blog exists), and traveling the world (preferably on motorcycle).
